Place uploader.sh in the folder where the sketch is present.
Also place the port.py and board_info.txt files in the same folder. 
Make sure you have python already installed and present in the $PATH.
If you don't have numpy: => then install numpy by using
	conda install numpy
		or
	pip install numpy 
If the script throws any error then make sure you the libraries install using arduino-cli [command exits]
check for syntax errors as well. 

=================== Any suggestion or correction is always welcome =====================
